  OpenTTD is playable with the free graphics files from the openttd-opengfx
  package and optional sound files from the openttd-opensfx package (which
  is in non-free). Alternatively, OpenTTD can use the graphics files from
  the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe game (See README.Debian on how to set
  this up).

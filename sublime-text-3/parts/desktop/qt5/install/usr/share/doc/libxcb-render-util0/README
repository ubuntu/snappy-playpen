About XCB util modules
======================

The XCB util modules provides a number of libraries which sit on top
of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.

If you find any of these libraries useful, please let us know what
you're using and why you aren't in a mental hospital yet. We'd welcome
patches/suggestions for enhancement and new libraries; Please report any
issues you find to the freedesktop.org bug tracker, at:

  <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XCB>

Discussion about XCB occurs on the XCB mailing list:

  <mailto:xcb at lists.freedesktop.org>

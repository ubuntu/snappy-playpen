 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
     be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
     recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
     constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
     Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
     synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
     ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
     this License.
 2.  "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
     as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
     in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
     License.
 3.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
     relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that
     license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction
     license with the same License Elements as this License.
 4.  "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
     copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
     other transfer of ownership.
 5.  "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes
     as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
     Attribution, ShareAlike.
 6.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 7.  "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
     the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
     or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and
     in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
     musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,
     declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or
     artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
     phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
     fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the
     case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
 8.  "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
     terms of this License including without limitation any production in
     the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
     mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a
     book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
     other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;
     a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
     are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
     cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
     are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
     photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
     sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
     architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
     compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
     work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
     extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 9.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 10. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
     and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
     means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
     digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
     a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
     and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to
     the public by any means or process and the communication to the
     public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
     performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means
     including signs, sounds or images.
 11. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
     without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
     fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of
     a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
     electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
 2.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
     Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
 3.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
     incorporated in Collections; and,
 4.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
     1.  Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
         in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
     2.  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
         by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
     3.  Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
     terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
     ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
     to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
     sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
     this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
     that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
     applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
     not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
     as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 2.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
     terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
     with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
     Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
     version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
     (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
     Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
     licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
     license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
     licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
     you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
     and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
     URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
     You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose
     any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
     Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
     to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
     the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
     refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
     with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
     Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
     of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
     granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
     This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
     Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
     Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
     License.
 3.  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
     or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
     the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
     supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
     another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
     entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
     Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
     means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
     if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
     such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
     information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
     Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
     Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
     implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
     case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
     appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
     or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
     at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
     required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
     manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
     License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
     connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
     use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
     permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
     Parties.
 4.  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
     or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
     be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
     Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
     any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
     (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
     mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
     the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
     or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
     permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
     (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
     Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 2.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
     License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.
 6.  The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
     Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
     amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
     WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
     Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
     July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
     relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
     enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
     law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
     License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
     License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
     rights under applicable law.

 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
     below) for the purposes of this License.
 2.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
     is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
     the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 3.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 4.  "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
     entities who created the Work.
 5.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
     terms of this License.
 6.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
 limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
 2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
     Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";;
 3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 4.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
     1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
         event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
         public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.
     2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
         rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
         royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
         version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
         equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
     doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
     performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
     public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
     the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
     Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
 are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
     You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
     This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
     Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
     from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested.
 2.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
     the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
     utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
     applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
     Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
     other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
     of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
     Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
     consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
     Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
     as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
     the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
 LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
 OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
 MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
 THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in
     Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
     Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
     the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
     You under this License.
 2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.

 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
     below) for the purposes of this License.
 2.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
     relicensing of derivatives of works made available under that
     license under this License or either a Creative Commons unported
     license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
     License Elements as this License.
 3.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
     is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
     the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 4.  "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes
     as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:

 limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
 2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
     Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
 3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

     transmission Derivative Works.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

     1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
         event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
         public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.
     2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
         rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
         royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
         version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
         equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
     doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
     performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
     public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
     the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
     Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor

 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
     You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
     of the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
     License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
     Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
     from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested.
 2.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of
     this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
     License Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons
     (Unported) license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
     (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
     License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
     (Unported)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you
     license the Derivative Work under one of the licenses mentioned in
     (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license
     the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned
     in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
     with the terms of the Applicable License generally and with the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
     Resource Identifier for, the Applicable License with every copy or
     phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform; (II) You
     may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
     restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
     the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute,
     publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
     the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the
     Derivative Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section
     4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
     Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
     Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of the
     Applicable License.
 3.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
     the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
     utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
     applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
     Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
     other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
     of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
     Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
     consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
     Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
     as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
     the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
 LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
 OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
 MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
 THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
     Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
     Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
     the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
     You under this License.
 2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.

 La Licenza
 .
 L’OPERA (COME SOTTO DEFINITA) È MESSA A DISPOSIZIONE SULLA BASE DEI
 TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA “CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE” (‘CCPL’
 O ‘LICENZA’). L’OPERA E’ PROTETTA DAL DIRITTO D’AUTORE E/O DALLE ALTRE
 LEGGI APPLICABILI. OGNI UTILIZZAZIONE DELL’OPERA CHE NON SIA AUTORIZZATA
 AI SENSI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DEL DIRITTO D’AUTORE È PROIBITA.
 .
 CON IL SEMPLICE ESERCIZIO SULL’OPERA DI UNO QUALUNQUE DEI DIRITTI QUI DI
 SEGUITO ELENCATI, TU ACCETTI E TI OBBLIGHI A RISPETTARE INTEGRALMENTE I
 TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA AI SENSI DEL PUNTO 8.f. IL LICENZIANTE
 CONCEDE A TE I DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI A CONDIZIONE CHE TU
 ACCETTI DI RISPETTARE I TERMINI E LE CONDIZIONI DI CUI ALLA PRESENTE
 LICENZA.
 .
 1. Definizioni. Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si
 intende per
 .
 1.  "Collezione di Opere", un’opera, come un numero di un periodico,
     un’antologia o un’enciclopedia, nella quale l’Opera nella sua
     interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi
     costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in
     un’unità collettiva. Un’opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere
     non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini
     della presente Licenza;
 2.  "Opera Derivata", un’opera basata sull’Opera ovvero sull’Opera
     insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un
     arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo,
     cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione
     d’arte, un digesto, una sintesi, od ogni altra forma in cui l’Opera
     possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui
     un’Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di
     Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della
     presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando
     l’Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la
     sincronizzazione dell’Opera in relazione con un’immagine in
     movimento (“synching”) sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di
     questa Licenza;
 3.  "Licenziante", l’individuo o l’ente che offre l’Opera secondo i
     termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza;
 4.  "Autore Originario", il soggetto che ha creato l’Opera;
 5.  "Opera", l’opera dell’ingegno suscettibile di protezione in forza
     delle leggi sul diritto d’autore, la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel
     rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza;
 6.  "Tu"/"Te", l’individuo o l’ente che esercita i diritti derivanti
     dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i
     termini della presente Licenza relativi all’Opera, o che, nonostante
     una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa
     autorizzazione dal Licenziante all’esercizio dei diritti derivanti
     dalla presente Licenza;
 7.  "Elementi della Licenza", gli attributi fondamentali della Licenza
     scelti dal Licenziante ed indicati nel titolo della Licenza:
     Attribuzione, Condividi allo stesso modo.
 .
 2. Libere utilizzazioni. La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo
 ridurre, limitare o restringere alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o
 l’operare della regola dell’esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni
 dei diritti esclusivi sull’Opera derivanti dalla legge sul diritto
 d’autore o da altre leggi applicabili.
 .
 3. Concessione della Licenza. Nel rispetto dei termini e delle
 condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te
 una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per
 la durata del diritto d’autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare
 i diritti sull’Opera qui di seguito elencati:
 .
 1.  riproduzione dell’Opera, incorporazione dell’Opera in una o più
     Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell’Opera come incorporata nelle
     Collezioni di Opere;
 2.  creazione e riproduzione di un’Opera Derivata;
 3.  distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui
     l’Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione,
     esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la
     trasmissione audio digitale dell’Opera, e ciò anche quando l’Opera
     sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere;
 4.  distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui
     l’Opera Derivata è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico,
     rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico,
     ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale di Opere Derivate.
 5.  Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l’Opera sia di tipo
     musicale
 .
     1.  Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione
         od esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante
         rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi,
         personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva
         (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la
         rappresentazione od esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es.
         tramite webcast) dell’Opera.
     2.  Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto
         esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite
         di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco
         che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall’Opera (versione
         cover).
 .
 6.  Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell’Opera mediante
     fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l’Opera è una
     registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo
     di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di
     gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico
     dell’Opera, anche in forma digitale.
 7.  Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare
     dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di
     riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul
     diritto d’autore (ad es. per l’inserimento dell’Opera in
     un’antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941). Al
     Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui
     attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l’equo compenso spettante
     all’autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di
     sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi
     dell’art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
 .
 I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di
 comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si
 intende compreso il diritto di apportare all’Opera le modifiche che si
 rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l’esercizio di detti diritti
 tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tutti i diritti
 non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati.
 .
 4. Restrizioni. La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3
 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni
 .
 1.  Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare,
     eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, anche in forma
     digitale, solo assicurando che i termini di cui alla presente
     Licenza siano rispettati e, insieme ad ogni copia dell’Opera (o
     supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l’Opera) che distribuisci,
     comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in
     pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della
     presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi
     proporre od imporre alcuna condizione relativa all’Opera che alteri
     o restringa i termini della presente Licenza o l’esercizio da parte
     del beneficiario dei diritti qui concessi. Non puoi concedere
     l’Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative
     che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all’esclusione delle
     garanzie. Non puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico,
     rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera,
     neanche in forma digitale, usando misure tecnologiche miranti a
     controllare l’accesso all’Opera ovvero l’uso dell’Opera, in maniera
     incompatibile con i termini della presente Licenza. Quanto sopra si
     applica all’Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione
     di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di
     per sé ed indipendentemente dall’Opera stessa debba essere soggetta
     ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu
     crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante,
     devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente
     possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da
     richiesta. Qualora tu crei un’Opera Derivata, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall’Opera Derivata stessa,
     nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento a tale
     Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale
     Autore Originario, come da richiesta.
 2.  Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare,
     eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, anche in forma
     digitale, solo assicurando che i termini di cui alla presente
     Licenza siano rispettati e, insieme ad ogni copia dell’Opera (o
     supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l’Opera) che distribuisci,
     comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in
     pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della
     presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi
     proporre od imporre alcuna condizione relativa all’Opera che alteri
     o restringa i termini della presente Licenza o l’esercizio da parte
     del beneficiario dei diritti qui concessi. Non puoi concedere
     l’Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative
     che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all’esclusione delle
     garanzie. Non puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico,
     rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera,
     neanche in forma digitale, usando misure tecnologiche miranti a
     controllare l’accesso all’Opera ovvero l’uso dell’Opera, in maniera
     incompatibile con i termini della presente Licenza. Quanto sopra si
     applica all’Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione
     di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di
     per sé ed indipendentemente dall’Opera stessa debba essere soggetta
     ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu
     crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante,
     devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente
     possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da
     richiesta. Qualora tu crei un’Opera Derivata, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall’Opera Derivata stessa,
     nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento a tale
     Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale
     Autore Originario, come da richiesta.
 3.  Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua,
     reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l’Opera o
     qualsiasi Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, devi mantenere
     intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d’autore sull’Opera. Devi
     riconoscere all’Autore Originale una menzione adeguata rispetto al
     mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi citando il nome (o lo
     pseudonimo, se del caso) dell’Autore Originale, ove fornito; il
     titolo dell’Opera, ove fornito; nella misura in cui sia
     ragionevolmente possibile, l’Uniform Resource Identifier, che il
     Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l’Opera, salvo che
     tale URI non faccia riferimento alla informazione di protezione di
     diritto d’autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell’Opera;
     inoltre, in caso di Opera Derivata, devi menzionare l’uso dell’Opera
     nell’Opera Derivata (ad esempio, “traduzione francese dell’Opera
     dell’Autore Originario”, o “sceneggiatura basata sull’Opera
     originaria dell’Autore Originario”). Tale menzione deve essere
     realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso,
     in ipotesi di Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, tale menzione
     deve quantomeno essere posta nel medesimo punto dove viene indicato
     il nome di altri autori di rilevanza paragonabile e con lo stesso
     risalto concesso alla menzione di altri autori di rilevanza
     paragonabile.
 .
 5. Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
 .
 SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE
 PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L’OPERA IN LICENZA “COSI’ COM’E’” E NON
 FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO
 ALL’OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA OD IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO
 TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL
 TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL’IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA
 NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O
 DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL’ESATTEZZA OD ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI
 ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L’ESCLUSIONE DI
 GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
 .
 6. Limitazione di Responsabilità. SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE
 APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI
 CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE,
 INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO OD ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA
 PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL’USO DELL’OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL
 LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA
 CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITA’ NEL CASO
 IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
 .
 7. Risoluzione
 .
 1.  La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con
     essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna
     comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di
     qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da
     parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a,
     4.b e 4.c, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente
     al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione
     della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquistati da
     individui o enti che abbiano acquistato da Te Opere Derivate o
     Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione
     che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le
